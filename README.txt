Simple python port scanner.
Programmed by Joshua Myers 2022
This port scanner (is going to) use multithreading to scan as many ports as fast as possible. 
The port scanner will display all open ports with a given ip, exposing any unneccesarily opened ports and hence, securty threats to the network. 
Do not use the port scanner for any network that you dont own or have rights to use. 
Port scanning unauthorised networks is illegal.
